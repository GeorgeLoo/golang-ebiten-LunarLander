Software toys concept 
*************************************************

1 2 arrows wasd U 


have random stars
Two or more screen lunar surface!

deorbit burn while docked
show deorbit by not drawing surface

fuel consumption

explosions

command module cannot land on the Moon
detect crashes
detect improper undocking boomz
detect too fast a descent

filepath for the data should be platform independent

-------------------------------


	22.10.2017 2221h
retro also uses fuel
affects speed as well

--- 22.10.2017 0202h

better landing with retros off 
better docking code 
use keystates instead

Removed the running slowly and it was still slow.

bug - some sideways landing positions the rocket has no effect
command module pushes lunar module while docked

docking to command module
undocking from command module

command module
Tab or 1,2 to switch ships!
Enlarged Command Module by 200%
reuse LEM code!
draw command module

bug acceleration during descent burn!
bug fuel burned too quickly

sound
retro thruster animation?!
four direction translation controls!
thrust direction
travel direction
fuel
thrust
height
descent speed
horizontal speed
full screen
landing zone
nice surface graphics
WASD for up down left right translation
bug ship fails to rotate if not in focus
